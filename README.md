# SQL Data Cleaning Project: Enhancing Data Quality for Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning the "Layoffs" dataset using SQL. Below is a high-level mapping of the key steps taken to clean and preprocess the data.

---

## 1. **Remove Duplicates**
- **Objective**: Identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset.
- **Approach**: 
  - Create a staging table for processing.
  - Use `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` to detect duplicates.
  - Remove duplicates based on a condition.

---

## 2. **Standardize the Data**
- **Objective**: Standardize key fields for consistency.
- **Approach**:
  - Trim extra spaces from text fields (e.g., company names).
  - Standardize date formats to a single consistent format.
  - Unify industry names to ensure uniformity (e.g., "Crypto" as a standard term).

---

## 3. **Handle NULL and Blank Values**
- **Objective**: Handle missing or blank values in key columns.
- **Approach**:
  - Identify rows with missing values in columns such as industry and total laid-off numbers.
  - Use `JOIN` to fill missing data from related records when applicable.

---

## 4. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**
- **Objective**: Clean up the dataset by removing irrelevant columns.
- **Approach**:
  - Drop columns that do not contribute to the analysis (e.g., temporary columns used during cleaning).

---

## 5. **Final Cleaned Dataset**
- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for further analysis.
- **Approach**:
  - Ensure the dataset is now free of duplicates, missing values, and unnecessary columns, and it is in a standardized format for analysis.

---

## Summary of SQL Concepts Used
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: For identifying and handling duplicates.
- **Window Functions**: Specifically `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank and filter duplicates.
- **String Manipulation**: To clean text fields (e.g., `TRIM`, `SUBSTRING`).
- **CASE Statements**: To handle conditional updates, especially for date formats.
- **Joins**: To enrich data and fill missing values.

## Next Steps
1. Clone the repository and set up the SQL environment.
2. Run the queries to clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. Use the cleaned data for detailed analysis or reporting.
